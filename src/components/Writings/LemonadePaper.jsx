          <h2>1. The Release and Initial Reception</h2>
          <p>
            The release of 'Lemonade' itself marked a departure from conventional music industry practices. Unlike typical album rollouts with pre-release singles and extensive marketing campaigns, 'Lemonade' debuted unexpectedly as an hour-long film on HBO, simultaneously becoming available for streaming on Tidal. This strategy echoed the surprise release of Beyoncé's self-titled album in 2013. This calculated move challenged established music distribution models and instantly generated immense public attention and critical discussion, positioning Beyoncé as an artist willing to innovate and disrupt the status quo.

          <h2>2. Themes of Race and Black Womanhood</h2>
          <p>
            'Lemonade' directly and powerfully engaged with themes of race and Black womanhood through its visual and lyrical content. The album features an unapologetic celebration of Black identity, heritage, and culture. The lead single, "Formation," released prior to the album, served as a potent anthem of Black pride, incorporating references to Southern culture, New Orleans, and African American vernacular.

          <h2>3. Narrative of Betrayal and Healing</h2>
          <p>
            At its core, 'Lemonade' navigated the complex terrain of betrayal through the intensely personal narrative of infidelity. The album explicitly addressed the alleged unfaithfulness of Beyoncé's husband, Jay-Z, laying bare a range of raw and unfiltered emotions. Feelings of hurt, anger, suspicion, and ultimately, forgiveness were palpable throughout the lyrics and visuals.
